## 🎮 Overview

This interactive basketball game builds upon the static court from HW05, introducing realistic physics-based gameplay using THREE.js. Players can move, shoot, and receive dynamic feedback with accurate rim and backboard collision responses. The game features scoring, physics, UI feedback, and celebratory confetti for made shots.

## 🛠️ Features & Tasks (HW06)

### 1. 🏀 Interactive Ball Controls
- Move with `Arrow Keys` (X-Z axis movement on court).
- Adjust shot power:
  - `W`: Increase
  - `S`: Decrease
- `Spacebar`: Shoot the ball.
- `R`: Reset ball to center court.

### 2. 💥 Physics-Based Shooting Mechanics
- Realistic parabolic arc based on direction and power.
- Gravity affects ball trajectory.
- Collision with:
  - **Rim** (top, bottom, sides)
  - **Backboard**
  - **Ground** with energy loss and spin
- Ball rolls after bounce with friction.

### 3. 🧠 Scoring Logic & Game State
- +2 points for a made shot (`SWISH` or `Shooter’s Bounce`).
- Game tracks:
  - Total attempts
  - Successful shots
  - Accuracy (%)
  - Score

### 4. 🎉 Game Feedback & Visual Effects
- Message banner: `SWISH!`, `MISS!`, `Hit the Rim!`, etc.
- Confetti animation after every made shot.
- Real-time scoreboard with power meter and stats panel.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- Scene built on top of `hw5.js` court — must load first.
- Manual physics and animation loop using `deltaTime`.
- Ball rotation responds to velocity (e.g., backspin, roll).
- UI created programmatically (DOM manipulation only).
- Includes rim, backboard, and ground bounce with damping.

## 🕹️ Controls Summary

| Key         | Function                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Arrow Keys  | Move basketball (X/Z court)      |
| W / S       | Increase / Decrease shot power   |
| Spacebar    | Shoot the ball                   |
| R           | Reset to center court            |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure `hw5.js` is loaded before `hw6.js` in your HTML file.
3. Open the project in a browser (recommended with local server).
4. No HTML modification needed — all UI elements generated by `hw6.js`.

## ✨ Bonus Features

- **Confetti Explosion** when a shot is made.
- **Soft rim contact** can still count as a score.
- **Rolling physics** after ball bounces on ground.
- **Backspin and spin-based angular momentum** applied realistically.
- Handles edge cases: missed shots, backboard hits, bounce-outs.
